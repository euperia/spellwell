        <h1>About SpellWell</h1>
        <p>SpellWell was created to help my 9 year old son learn his spellings for tests at school.
          He would get 16 words to learn over the week and would have a test on Fridays. The trouble is that he's a visual learner
          and needs interaction to learn.
        </p>
        <p>I created SpellWell with the hope that it would help him learn in a fun way.</p>
